# e-menu

## Description
This is a simple application to manage menus in a restaurant. It allows to create menus, menu positions and send them to the users via email.

App is written in FastAPI and uses PostgreSQL as a database.

## Database
Database have tables such as:
### 1. users
It stores user's email, login and password, which are encrypted. It is being used for authentication, also for sending emails.

### 2. menu_positions
This table stores menu positions, which can be a single dishes in the menu. It stores the name, description, price and the creation / updates dates.

### 3. menus
This table stores the menus. It stores the name.

### 4. menu_menu_positions
Because of the many-to-many relationship between menus and menu_positions, this table is created to store the relations between them.
With that, every menu position know which menus it belongs to and every menu knows which menu positions it contains.
Records are being automatically deleted when the menu or menu position is deleted.

### 5. mail_pool
Sending emails require from us to search whole menu_positions table for the positions created yesterday, which can be a heavy operation.
Because of that, there is mail_pool table, which stores foreign keys to the menu_positions created or updated in the last time.
When it comes to sending emails, we can just search for the records in the mail_pool table and send the emails to the users.
At the end, we can delete the records from the mail_pool table (not those one that were created today: those one are being sent in the next day).
